Description: An assortment of helper functions for doing structural equation
  modeling, mainly by 'lavaan' for now. Most of them are time-saving functions
  for common tasks in doing structural equation modeling and reading the
  output. This package is not for functions that implement advanced statistical
  procedures. It is a light-weight package for simple functions that do simple
  tasks conveniently, with as few dependencies as possible.
